Coli O157 is another bacteria which also causes food poisoning.\nCooking raw foods destroys these germs. But germs from raw food can contaminate cooked foods. We call this cross contamination.\nIf cooked food is re-contaminated and left at room temperature there&rsquo;&rsquo;s a risk the germs will grow. This could cause food poisoning.\nRemember, cooked food includes food served cold, like pies, pasties and cold meat.\nCross contamination can happen when you:\n* use the same utensils to prepare raw and cooked foods\n* store raw meat near or touching cooked foods\n* store raw meat above cooked foods in a refrigerator, moisture or blood may drip onto food below\n* prepare cooked food on a surface that&rsquo;&rsquo;s had raw meat on it\n* wipe your work surface with a contaminated cloth\n* don&rsquo;t wash your hands between preparing raw and cooked food\n* have uncovered waste food, because vermin or insects can pass germs onto open food or work surfaces and utensils\nFollow these simple rules when you prepare food to avoid the risk of food poisoning.\nYou should:\n* store raw and cooked foods in separate areas or fridges, if this is not possible ",
