<h2>Safe Grilling: Ensuring Correct Internal Temperatures for Meat</h2>

<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (Youdle) – Grilling meat to perfection is an art, but it's also a science. Ensuring your meat reaches safe internal temperatures is crucial not just for taste, but also for health. Undercooked or overcooked meat can lead to health risks or a less than savory meal.</p>

<p>The USDA provides guidelines on safe internal temperatures for various types of meat. It's important to note that the appearance or color of the meat isn't always a reliable indicator of its safety, so having accurate temperature information is key.</p>

<p>Not all meats require the same cooking temperatures. Factors such as the size and type of the cut, as well as your cooking method, can influence the optimal temperature. Here are the basic guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beef, Pork, Veal, Lamb - 145°F (with a 3-minute rest time)</li>
<li>Ground meats - 160°F</li>
<li>Poultry (whole, pieces & ground) - 165°F</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your grilled meats are both delicious and safe to eat. Always remember, when in doubt, check the temperature!</p>
