Worrisome findings include a genetic cluster of Extended-Spectrum β-lactamase–Producing <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> in humans and food in Switzerland, a retrospective analysis of historical <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> clinical isolates in New York, USA, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant <em>Salmonella enterica</em> in poultry and humans in Israel.

  <li><em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7 associated with multiple food sources in the United States</li>
  <li>Community outbreak of OXA-48–Producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> linked to food premises in New Zealand</li>
  <li>Effects of decentralized sequencing on national <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> genomic surveillance in Australia</li>
