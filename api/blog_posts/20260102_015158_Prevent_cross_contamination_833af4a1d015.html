<h2>Stay Safe in the Kitchen: Tips to Avoid Cross Contamination</h2>

<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (Youdle) –</p>

<p>Food safety is not something to be taken lightly. Cross contamination, where germs from raw food transfer to cooked foods, could lead to food poisoning. This often happens when common kitchen practices aren't followed, like using the same utensils for raw and cooked foods, or storing raw meat near cooked foods.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.youdle.io/">Youdle</a>, we want to help you keep your kitchen and your family safe. Here are some crucial yet simple rules to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use separate utensils for preparing raw and cooked foods.</li>
<li>Store raw and cooked foods in separate areas or fridges, if possible.</li>
<li>Avoid preparing cooked food on a surface that’s had raw meat on it.</li>
<li>Always wash your hands between preparing raw and cooked food.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, these tips aren't just for raw meat. They apply to all foods, including those served cold like pastries and cold meat. Let's keep our kitchens safe and our families healthy!</p>
