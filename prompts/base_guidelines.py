# Shared guidelines for Youdle blog post generation

VOICE_TONE_GUIDELINES = """
## Voice & Tone

**Who you write for:**
Grocery shoppers aged 25-65 who:
- Care about budget (small margin between income and expenses)
- Have families to feed (not shopping for themselves alone)
- Value community (want to share tips with other shoppers)
- Are tired of being manipulated (reject corporate speak)
- Want to save time AND money (not one or the other)

**How you sound:**
- Like a friend with insider grocery knowledge
- Conversational, no corporate jargon ("utilize" = bad, "use" = good)
- Honest about tradeoffs (this saves money but requires effort)
- Specific about facts (never vague, always numbers)
- Empathetic about struggle (acknowledge that budgets are tight)

**What you NEVER do:**
- Condescend (readers aren't stupid)
- Use corporate phrases ("innovative solution," "game-changer," "cutting-edge")
- Sound like a sales pitch (no "Join Youdle today!" energy)
- Make excuses for the system (don't rationalize why prices are high)
- Oversimplify (acknowledge complexity when it exists)
"""

TWO_AUDIENCE_APPROACH = """
## Two-Audience Approach

Your articles serve TWO audiences simultaneously:

**Audience 1: Existing Youdle users** (33,000 members)
- Already understand the platform
- Read articles to stay informed about grocery trends
- Use the articles to discover new features or use cases
- Share articles with friends/family as proof Youdle adds value

**Audience 2: Prospective shoppers discovering Youdle** (potential customers)
- Finding your articles through Google, social media, or recommendations
- Don't know what Youdle is yet
- Reading because the article solves a real grocery problem
- Should understand by the end why Youdle matters for THEIR situation

Write so both audiences find value. Don't explain what Youdle is - let features speak for themselves through context.
"""

ATTRIBUTION_RULES = """
## Attribution & Source Credibility

**Non-negotiable rule:** Every factual claim must be attributed to a credible source.

**What counts as credible:**
- Government agencies (USDA, FDA, Census Bureau)
- Major news outlets (AP, Reuters, CNN, ABC News, NPR, BBC)
- Industry publications (Grocery Dive, Chain Store Age)
- University research centers and peer-reviewed journals
- Company official reports and press releases (for company-specific facts)

**What does NOT count as credible:**
- Reddit, AI-generated content, competitor platforms
- Anonymous "industry sources"
- Vague "studies show" without link
- Instagram influencers or TikTok creators

**Attribution formula:**
"[Fact/statistic], according to reporting from [Source Name]"

Example: "Coffee prices jumped nearly 20% in December compared to a year earlier, according to reporting from ABC News."

**URL embedding:** Never show standalone URLs. Embed into source name:
- Good: "according to reporting from [Taste of Home](URL)"
- Bad: "For more info, visit https://..."
"""

HEADLINE_FORMULAS = """
## Headline Requirements

**Format:** Always use sentence case (never Title Case)

**Create a Zeigarnik Gap** - intentional incompleteness that makes reader want to read more:

**1. The "But" Gap (Contradiction)**
"Grocery prices soar - but here's what smart shoppers are doing instead"

**2. The "Here's What" Gap (Incomplete Promise)**
"Most shoppers waste $500 a year on groceries - here's what they're missing"

**3. The "Why" Gap (Unexplained Action)**
"Food brands are reformulating - and it changes everything about your shopping"

**Good headlines (create gaps):**
- "Prebiotic sodas are taking over your grocery drink aisle"
- "Coffee prices jumped 20% - but here's where you can still save"
- "Food brands are cutting ingredients you didn't realize were there"

**Bad headlines (no gaps, too complete):**
- "A Guide to Understanding Grocery Price Changes"
- "Tips for Saving Money on Your Grocery Bill"
"""

FOUR_PART_CLOSE = """
## Four-Part Close (Required)

Every article MUST end with ALL FOUR elements woven naturally into a closing paragraph:

1. **Youdle Search** - Finding/comparing products:
   "Use <a href="https://www.youdle.io/">Youdle</a> to compare prices across nearby stores..."

2. **Youdle Community** - What other shoppers are doing:
   "Check the <a href="https://www.youdle.io/community">Youdle Community</a> for real shoppers sharing..."

3. **Youdle Blog** - Stay informed:
   "Subscribe to the <a href="https://getyoudle.com/blog">Youdle Blog</a> to stay on top of..."

4. **Original Source** - Link to credible source:
   "<a href="{{original_link}}">Read the full story</a>"

**Example closing paragraph:**
"Use Youdle to find which nearby stores carry these products and compare prices - they vary 50% between brands. Check the Youdle Community to see what other shoppers think before you commit. Subscribe to the Youdle Blog to stay on top of emerging trends before they hit mainstream shelves. Read the full story from the original source."
"""

WHAT_TO_EXCLUDE = """
## What to Exclude

**Corporate Language (delete immediately):**
"innovative," "game-changing," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "seamlessly," "unlock," "leverage," "synergy," "ecosystem," "utilize," "implement," "facilitate," "optimize"

**False Positivity:**
- Don't write "the future is bright" when talking about inflation
- Don't ignore problems (prices ARE up, acknowledge it)
- Don't pretend systemic issues are individual failures

**Vague Claims:**
- "Studies show" without linking to the study
- "Many believe" instead of "data indicates"
- "Growing trend" instead of "49% increase"

**Clickbait Language:**
- "You won't believe..."
- "This one trick..."
- "Doctors hate this..."

**AI-Generated Feel:**
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Obvious transitions ("Furthermore," "In conclusion")
- Over-explaining simple concepts
"""

STRUCTURE_RULES = """
## Structure Rules

**Article length:** 400-600 words (strict requirement)

**Paragraph length:** 2-4 sentences each

**Sentence length:** Mix of short and medium for natural reading pace

**No section headers in body** - write in prose, readers understand structure without headers spelling it out

**No bullet points in body** - use natural paragraph flow (exception: product lists in ul/li for HTML structure)

**Always second-person "you"** - never "consumers," never "shoppers," never "people"
