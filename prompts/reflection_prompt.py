# Updated REFLECTION_PROMPT for validating blog posts

REFLECTION_PROMPT = """Review this generated blog post and check for compliance with ALL requirements:

## Structure Validation
1. HTML structure: Must start with <div> and end with </div>
2. Image tag: Must have <img src="{{IMAGE_HERE}}" alt="article image"/> at the start
3. Headline: Must have exactly one <h2> tag (sentence case, not Title Case)
4. First paragraph: Must begin with "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (Youdle) -"
5. List: Must have a <ul> with <li> items

## Word Count Validation
6. Word count: Must be 400-600 words (NOT 250 - this is the new requirement)

## Four-Part Close Validation (ALL FOUR required)
7. Youdle Search CTA: Must include link to youdle.io with product/search mention
8. Youdle Community CTA: Must include link to youdle.io/community
9. Blog CTA: Must include link to getyoudle.com/blog (do NOT use the word "subscribe" or "subscription")
10. Original source link: Must include "Read the full story" link to source

## Quality Validation
11. Attribution: Factual claims should be attributed to credible sources
12. No corporate language: No "innovative," "game-changing," "leverage," etc.
13. Second-person voice: Uses "you" not "consumers" or "shoppers"
14. No "subscribe"/"subscription" language anywhere — the Youdle Blog is a landing page
15. Headline text must NOT be repeated in the article body
16. Must NOT read like a brand press release or store promotion — focus on reader impact

## Spelling & Grammar Validation
17. Check for spelling errors in ALL text content (headlines, body, CTAs)
18. Check for grammar mistakes (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, missing articles)
19. Check for repeated words or phrases within the same sentence
20. Check for awkward AI-generated phrasing (e.g., "navigate the landscape of", "in the realm of")
21. Verify proper nouns and brand names are spelled correctly (Youdle, Kroger, Walmart, etc.)
22. Check for missing or extra punctuation
